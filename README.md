# Aircraft Business Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 to help my company make informed decisions when expanding into the aviation industry.  
Techniques used include: data cleaning, aggregation and visualization, to understand accident trends and recommend safer aircraft models for investment.

## Business Understanding
The company is expanding into new industries, specifically aviation operations for commercial and private sectors.  
They want to identify low-risk aircraft models and operational practices to minimize accident exposure.  
**Stakeholder:** Head of the new Aviation Division  
**Key Business Questions:**
- Which aircraft models are the safest?
- During which flight phases do most accidents occur? 
- What types of flights carry the highest risks? 

## Data Understanding and Analysis
**Source:** National Transportation Safety Board aviation accident data.  
The dataset includes information on accidents and incidents from 1962â€“2023 involving civil aviation.

**Key Features:**
- Aircraft Make and Model
- Purpose of Flight
- Broad Phase of Flight
- Injury Severity
- Number of Fatal, Serious, and Minor Injuries

**Visualizations:**
- Pie chart: Top 10 Aircraft Makes and Models with zero injuries
- Bar Chart: Accidents by Broad Phase of Flight
- Bar Chart: Accidents by Purpose of Flight
- Pie Chart: Distribution of major injury severities (Non fatal, Fatal, Incident)

## Conclusion
**Key Findings:**
- Several aircraft models had zero recorded injuries across all incidents analyzed.
- Landing and Takeoff phases are the most accident-prone phases of flight.
- Personal and Instructional flights contribute to the majority of accident cases.
- Most accidents are Non-Fatal, but Fatal accidents are still significant and require serious safety measures.

## Recommendations

- Invest in Aircraft Models with Strong Safety Records
- Enhance Safety Protocols During Landing and Takeoff Phases
- Exercise Caution with Personal and Training Flight Operations
- Maintain Strong Emergency Response and Risk Management Systems despite the majority of accidents being Non-Fatal
